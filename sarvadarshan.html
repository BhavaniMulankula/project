Lord Venkateswara is known by many other names: Balaji, Govinda, and Srinivasa.
        
            <H1>Tirumala Tirupati History Details</H1>
            Srimad-Bhagavatam describes the history of Tirumala that during Satya yuga, Hiranyaksha, due to his exploitative activities created a situation where the earth was drowned to the bottom of the Garbhodaka ocean.<br> At that time, the demigods approached Lord Brahma who prayed to Lord Vishnu.Lord Vishnu then appeared from the nose of Brahma in the form of Sri Varahadev. <br>He killed Hiryanaksha and lifted the earth,<br> ‘Bhudevi’ with His tusks, and brought her to a safe position on top of the Garbhodaka ocean.Bhudevi, the goddess of the earth,<br> being an expansion of Goddess Laxmi was very much pleased to be reunited with Her Lord, Her eternal consort in the form of Sri Varahadev. In Vaikuntha ‘BhuVaraha’resideseternally, <br>so Bhudevi, who is the goddess of this earth, pleaded Lord Varahadev to remain with Her on this earth planet. <br>Sri Varahadev decided to satisfy her desire and called for Garuda to fly to Vaikuntha and bring one of His favourite mountains down to the earth,<br> so that He and Bhudevi could reside here together on that mountain. That mountain was brought down, <br>and it is today called ‘Tirumala’. It is the mountain that was carried from Vaikuntha by Garuda himself.
        
            There is also a story of Sesa, the divine expansion of the Lord who sometimes appears as His couch,sometimes as His bed, and sometimes as His slippers, the same Adisesha incarnated on this earth asthe seven hills in which Tirumala is situated. <br>Therefore the seven hills are called Seshadari. Knowing that the Supreme Lord would come to live on these hills, Sesha wanted to be there to support Hisdivine pastimes.
            
            As the narration continues, Narada Muni once approached great sages who performed yagna. Narada Muni enquired from them, <br>“To whom are you offering the fruits of yagna? Of all the devathas or demigods, who is the greatest?” Some rishis considered Brahma to be the greatest of the gods, some considered Vishnu, and some considered Siva to be the greatest. <br>In an intriguing dialogue that followed among them, to decide who is the greatest, <br>they all concluded that the greatest of the persons must be one, who is completely transcendental to the modes of material nature. <br>Thus they all unanimously elected Bhruga Muni to test these guna avatars, to see the greatest of the three.
